      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>First created in the late 1990s, Adequate Systems began first as a group of technology enthusiasts.  Later, we created a company in the US called Adequate Systems, LLC, which we worked on together to create things like the Mochimo Cryptocurrency Engine.  Now we also have a global company based in Hong Kong called Adequate Systems HK Limited allowing us to reach a larger global audience with our ideas.</p>
