      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Adequate Systems HK Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Adequate Systems HK Limited”, “we”, “us”, “our”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your Personal Information. “Personal Information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
      <p>For purposes of this Policy, “process” or “processing” means any operation which is performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information we collect when you use or access adequatelimited.com, Adequate Systems HK Limited and its third party applications, and other services or programs offered by Adequate Systems HK Limited that link to or reference this policy (together, with any and all future online and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Adequate Systems HK Limited, the “Services”).</p>
      <h2>Types of Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>As you interact with the Services, we may collect Personal Information from you. The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third-party sources) depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Adequate Systems HK Limited and the requirements of applicable law, as described below.</p>
      <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>We collect information you provide directly to us. When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account, requesting Services or information, verifying your identity through our Services, posting messages to our forums, or contacting us directly, we may collect information from you such as your name, user name and password, email address, telephone number(s), mailing address, government issued identification documents (e.g., passports, driver's license, etc.), selfie image, biometric information, IP Address, utility bills, and statements to prove your current residence (e.g., bank statements), and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
      <h3>Facial Biometric Identity Verification</h3>
      <p>Facial biometric identity verification is performed by comparing two or more captured images of faces. For example, we may compare the face on a government-issued photo ID against a “selfie” that you capture and send to us. The biometric identifiers used to perform this comparison are derived from the photographs that you submit.</p>
      <h3>Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
      <p>We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services.
